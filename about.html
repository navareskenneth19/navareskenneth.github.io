                    <h2>Kenneth Navares</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        I'm Kenneth Lagria Navares, a second-year student at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. <br> <br> 
                        I am the fifth of my seven siblings, having been born on May 19, 2002, in Zone 2 Canitoan, Cagayan de Oro City. Since there was little need for transportation at the time, I lived and attended school in a typical rural location where children just walked to school. I used to participate and engage in a lot more academic and community activities throughout my elementary school years. I even explored  leadership and service by participating in the supreme student government (highshool) and the Supreme Pupil government (elementary). <br> <br> 
                        I create poetry, reverse spoken poetry, and stories about mysteries, murders, love, and thrillers. I've previously competed in live events like Brigada News Conference as a broadcaster. I'm a consistent honor student from kinder to senior highshool.
                        Badminton is my preferred sport but I can also play basketball, baseball, and volleyball. The colors I adore are blue, black, and white. The best culinary combinations for me are fried chicken with Coca-Cola and Japanese siomai.
